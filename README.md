default password of deluge is "deluge".  
you must set deluge download path as "/downloads/incompleted", then move to "/downloads/completed"  
(don't forget to create those folders)

add deluge to sonarr/radarr with container hostnames and original port. 
host: "deluge" and port: "8112"  

jacket api link is,  
http://jackett:9117/api/v2.0/indexers/all/results/torznab/  


Nzbget Webui can be found at your-ip:6789 and the default login details (change ASAP) are  
login:nzbget, password:tegbzn6789
